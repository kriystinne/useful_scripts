### Script 1: download rmpt videos
In school, we had streaming videos for all our lectures. I inspired myself from [@vagnes](https://github.com/vagnes)'s script that works on windows to add the same functionality on a MAC.

Output method: Raw; this is because videos that are saved with the TS method do not work on a mac. Read more [here](https://www.videolan.org/streaming-features.html).

I also excuded the verbose option as it wasn't necessary.
